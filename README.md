## Overview  

`secure-auth-system`Â is a secure authentication system built with Flask, designed to manage user accounts and provide robust password handling and recovery features. It uses Argon2 for password hashing, stores user data in a SQLite database, and supports account creation, login, password resets, and backup code verification. The system integrates email functionality for sending backup codes and password reset notifications, and tracks user activity such as login attempts and password resets. Environment variables are used for sensitive email credentials, and CORS is configured to allow secure cross-origin requests from a specified frontend. Overall, the project aims to provide a secure, user-friendly authentication backend for web applications.

## Features  

- Secure user authentication with Argon2 password hashing
- Account creation with email verification
- Password reset functionality with backup codes
- Brute force protection with login attempt tracking
- Password strength requirements:
	- Minimum 12 characters
	- Must contain uppercase and lowercase letters
	- Must contain numbers and special characters
	- Dictionary word checks
	- Sequential character checks
- User activity tracking (login attempts, password resets, etc.)
- Responsive web interface.
